class BankAccount {
    long accountNumber;
    double balance;

    // Constructor
    BankAccount(long accountNumber, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    // Deposit method
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Please add a valid amount");
            return;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount b = new BankAccount(12345678, 123.45);

        b.deposit(450);
        b.withdraw(223);

        System.out.println("Current balance = " + b.checkBalance());
    }
}


Output:-
Amount deposited successfully!
Amount withdrawn successfully!
Current balance = 350.45

Concepts:- 
Method:- Method is a resuable piece of a code which performs some specific task
it is also known as function in other programing languages.

Types of Methods
Predefined Methods → Already defined in Java libraries
Example: System.out.println(), Math.sqrt(), length()
User-defined Methods → Created by the programmer 
eg.withdraw(),deposite() in above example

Key Points
Methods allow code reusability.
Each method belongs to a class.
A method may return a value or be void (no return).
You can pass parameters to methods.
