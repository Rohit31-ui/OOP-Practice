# OOP-Practice

## Defination
 OOP stands for object oriented programing. It is not a programming language it is most popular programming paradigram which resolves around objects and entities. It popular due to its features as - 1.Enhanced Security 2.Enhanced reusability 3.Easy Maintenance 
 It includes some important concepts as 1. class 2.objects and also the four pillars of object oriented programming are 1.Inheritance 2.Polymorphism 3.Encapsulation 4.Polymorphism

 ## class
 Class is a building block of an oops, it is alos known as blue print of objects it has datamembers and methods. 
 ### Real world example 1. human class 2.Animal class 3.Vehicle class

 ## Object
 Object is an instance of a class or any real world entity. The class has datamembers and methods but we need to create an object of class to access those.
###  Real world example 1.We are example of human class 2.Dog,cat,lion,etc are example of animal class 3.Car,bike,tractor,truck, etc are example of vehicle class

## Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

## 1. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (called child/subclass) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (called parent/superclass). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical relationships.

### Real-world examples:

### A Teacher class can inherit from a Person class.
### A Car class can inherit from a Vehicle class.


## 2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the wrapping of data (properties) and methods into a single unit or class. It allows restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which helps data protection.

### Real-world examples:

### Bank account details are private; we interact via deposit/withdraw methods.

### Medical records can only be accessed by authorized personnel.


## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means many forms. It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while performing different behaviors based on the actual object type.

### Real-world examples:
### A Shape class with draw() method: Circle and Rectangle implement it differently.
### Overloaded functions or methods performing differently with different arguments.

## 4. Abstraction

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features. It helps simplify usage and reduce complexity.

### Real-world examples:
### Driving a car: you just use the steering, brakes, and accelerator without knowing engine details.
### Using a smartphone: you interact with apps without knowing the internal code.
