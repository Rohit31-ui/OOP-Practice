class Car{
    //instance variable
    String brand;
    int speed;
    //constructor of a class
    Car(String brand,int speed){
        this.brand=brand;
        this.speed=speed;
    }
    
    public void drive(){
       System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Car c1=new Car("Toyato",120);
       c1.drive();
       
       Car c2=new Car("BMW",140);
       c2.drive();
    }
}

output:-
Toyato is driving at 120 km/h
BMW is driving at 140 km/h


Key Concepts:-
1.Constructor of a class:- It is a special type of a method which is used to initialise the newly created instance of a class;
it has properties like-
i.Same name as class name, ii. No return type iii. It is invoked as soon as the object of a class is created

2.Class :- It is a buliding block of object oriented programing, it is a blueprint of objects, it has data members and methods.
real world example - Vehicle class,human class,Animal class;

3.Object:- It is an instance of class, it is also known as a real world entity. the class has data members and methods but to access them we required to create an object of a class.
real world example - We all are example of objects of human class,dog,cat,lion are objects of animal class,car,bike,tractor,truck all are example of vehicle class.

4.this keyword:- Special refrence keyword, used to refer current object.
Usege:-
i.To differentiate between instance variables and local variables
ii.To call another constructor in the same class
iii.To pass the current object as an argument
